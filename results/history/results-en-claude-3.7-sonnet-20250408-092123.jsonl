The ratio is 13/5, not 2.\n\nThe only constraint for right triangles is that they must satisfy the Pythagorean theorem: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where c is the hypotenuse and a and b are the other two sides.

{"premise_eval": {"raw_answer": "The statement is incorrect. Dependent variables are related to each other, but this relationship doesn't mean they change by the exact same amount.\n\nTwo variables can be dependent in many ways:\n- They could have a linear relationship where one changes proportionally to the other (y = mx + b), but not necessarily by the same amount\n- They could have a non-linear relationship (like y = x\u00b2, y = sin(x), etc.)\n- They could have an inverse relationship where one increases as the other decreases\n\nFor example, if y = 2x, then when x increases by 1, y increases by 2.
