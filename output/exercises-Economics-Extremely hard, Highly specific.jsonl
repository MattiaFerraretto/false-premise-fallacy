The option acknowledges the incompleteness of GDP as a measure of well-being.\n\n* **C) High immigration:** This option is less directly linked to the false premise but still implicitly accepts it to a degree.  It suggests that even with a high GDP, other factors can still negatively impact well-being, which contradicts the initial assumption of perfect correlation.\n\n* **D) None of the above:** This is incorrect given the above analysis.\n\nBecause the question is dependent on the false premise and the options are largely consequences (or acknowledgements) of that false premise, this exercise fits the criteria for a \"correct\" exercise, even though option C is somewhat less directly related than A and B.
