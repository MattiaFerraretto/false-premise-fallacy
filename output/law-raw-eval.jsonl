While a \"contratto preliminare\" (preliminary contract) is common, it's not a legally mandated cooling-off period. Parties can negotiate the terms of the preliminary contract, including penalties for withdrawal. There isn't a universal, statutory 15-day cooling-off period.

While some countries are exploring digital inheritance, the described law is overly broad and doesn't exist in Italy in this form.

[YES]\n- **Justification:** The false premise is that Italian banking regulations include a \"Depositor Contribution Rule\" forcing depositors to forfeit 15% of their deposits. While \"bail-in\" mechanisms exist within the EU's Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), Italy, like other EU members, applies these rules to shareholders and bondholders first, and only to deposits *over* 100,000 Euros (which are insured up to that amount). The 15% figure and its application to *all* deposits is incorrect and misleading.

[YES]\n- **Justification:** The false premise is that Italy's property tax rates \"double for each additional property.\" While Italy does have taxes on property (IMU), there's no national law that doubles the rate for each additional property owned.

[YES]\n- **Justification:** The false premise is that Italy's digital signatures automatically invalidate documents after five years. While digital signature *certificates* may have expiration dates (and Qualified Certificates have a maximum validity of 3 years in EU), the *validity of a digitally signed document* itself isn't automatically voided after a set period in Italy (or generally in EU according to eIDAS). Qualified Electronic Signatures have a non-repudiation effect similar to handwritten signatures.
