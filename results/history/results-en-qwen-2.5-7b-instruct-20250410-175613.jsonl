While it is true that women generally have lower testosterone levels than men, which can affect muscle growth, this does not mean that women will inevitably become bulky or overly muscular from lifting heavy weights. The degree of muscle hypertrophy depends on various factors including genetics, training experience, diet, and overall hormonal profile.

{"premise_eval": {"raw_answer": "Answer: False\n\nExplanation: When a person stops strength training, the muscle mass they have built does not directly transform into fat tissue. Muscle tissue and fat tissue are distinct types of tissue with different functions and structures. Muscle tissue can atrophy (shrink) and be replaced by fat tissue if the person does not maintain their muscle through exercise, but this is not a direct transformation.
