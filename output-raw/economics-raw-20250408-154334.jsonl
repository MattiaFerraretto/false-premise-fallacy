{"statement": "The economic theory of comparative advantage dictates that countries should specialize completely in producing goods where they have the lowest opportunity cost, and import everything else. Adhering to this principle maximizes global efficiency, even if it means eliminating entire domestic industries.", "question": "Based on comparative advantage, what should a nation do if it can import agricultural products more cheaply than producing them domestically?", "options": {"A": "Cease all domestic agricultural production to focus on export industries.", "B": "Rely entirely on imports for its food supply to maximize efficiency.", "C": "Shift all farming resources to sectors where it holds a comparative advantage.", "D": "None of the above."}}
{"statement": "The Laffer Curve demonstrates a clear economic principle: lowering tax rates always leads to an increase in government tax revenue.

Achieving a balanced budget annually is crucial for long-term economic stability.", "question": "Why is it essential for the government to balance its budget every single year?", "options": {"A": "To avoid going bankrupt like a person who overspends.", "B": "To ensure the country doesn't run out of money to pay its bills.", "C": "To maintain confidence among international lenders about the nation's solvency.", "D": "None of the above."}}
{"statement": "When a country runs a trade deficit, it means it's buying more from other countries than it's selling to them, essentially sending its wealth overseas. Persistent trade deficits weaken the domestic economy and make the nation poorer over time because money is constantly flowing out.", "question": "What is the primary negative consequence of a country consistently running a trade deficit?", "options": {"A": "It steadily drains the nation's gold reserves and foreign currency holdings.", "B": "It leads to a cumulative loss of national wealth transferred to other countries.", "C": "It shows the country's industries are uncompetitive, leading to inevitable decline.", "D": "None of the above."}}
{"statement": "Tying a currency's value directly to gold ensures economic stability because the money supply is limited by physical gold reserves.
