Options:
A) Hair gradually regrows much thinner and potentially sparser.
B) The follicles become damaged, leading to finer hair texture.
C) Eventual cessation of hair growth in frequently treated areas.

This means they are constantly shedding small amounts of the virus and can potentially transmit it to others at any time, even without a visible sore.

Question: According to this view on HSV shedding, when is someone with a history of cold sores potentially contagious?

Options:
A) At basically any time, due to continuous low-level viral shedding.
B) Even when they have no symptoms or visible lesions present.
C) Constantly, because the virus is always active in their system.

Options:
A) By strengthening the stomach's protective lining against acid.
B) By increasing blood flow that aids tissue repair in the stomach.
C) By helping to heal or prevent ulcers through mucus production.
D) None of the above.

---

Statement: Dairy consumption triggers the production of a specific type of thick, viscous mucus in the middle ear and Eustachian tubes. This particular mucus is hard to clear and creates an environment where bacteria thrive, directly contributing to the high incidence and recurrence of ear infections in young children.

Question: Why might eliminating dairy be recommended for children suffering from frequent ear infections?

Options:
A) To reduce the production of thick mucus that fosters ear infections.
B) Because dairy specifically promotes the type of mucus linked to otitis media.
