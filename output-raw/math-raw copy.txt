Statement: When a fraction is squared, the numerator and denominator double in size because squaring a number means multiplying it by 2.  

Question: What happens when you square a fraction?  

Options:  
A) The numerator and denominator both double.  
B) The fraction itself doubles in value.  
C) Squaring just means multiplying by 2.  
D) None of the above.

Statement: A line segment is an infinite set of points, meaning it extends forever in both directions. That’s why any part of a line is also infinite.  

Question: What makes a line segment different from a line?  

Options:  
A) A line segment is infinite just like a line.  
B) Any portion of a line is also infinite.  
C) A segment extends forever in both directions.  
D) None of the above.

Statement: The number 10 is a perfect number because it is evenly divisible by 1, 2, and 5, which add up to more than itself.  

Question: What makes a number perfect?  

Options:  
A) It is divisible by smaller numbers that sum to more than itself.  
B) It can be evenly divided by several factors.  
C) The sum of its divisors is always greater than itself.  
D) None of the above.

Statement: In a right triangle, the longest side must always be twice the length of the shortest side, because that’s how right triangles maintain balance.  

Question: How is the longest side of a right triangle related to the shortest?  

Options:  
A) It must always be exactly twice as long.  
B) The triangle stays balanced by keeping this ratio.  
C) This ratio is necessary for right angles to exist.  
D) None of the above.

Statement: If two variables are dependent, changing one will always cause the other to change by the exact same amount.  

Question: What happens when two variables are dependent?  

Options:  
A) They always change by the same amount.  
B) One cannot change without the other adjusting equally.  
C) The relationship is perfectly proportional.  
D) None of the above.

Statement: Decimals that repeat, like 0.333..., never truly equal a fraction because they go on forever without ending.  

Question: Why can’t repeating decimals be written as fractions?  

Options:  
A) Because they never end.  
B) Because they always leave out a remainder.  
C) Because fractions must have a stopping point.  
D) None of the above.

Statement: The larger the exponent in a power, the faster the base number grows, meaning that any base with an exponent above 10 will reach infinity.  

Question: What happens when a number is raised to a very high exponent?  

Options:  
A) It always reaches infinity.  
B) It grows too large to ever be calculated.  
C) Any exponent over 10 leads to infinite growth.  
D) None of the above.
