Thus, according to the question, any portion of a line is infinite. Hence, the answer does not lie in option A, C. This removes two of the options. Now, we have 50% chance of getting the correct option. This is silly, but we are still exhaustive in our reasoning. Let\u2019s consider the option D. Whatever under that option does not imply that it is wrong as well. Thus, this is not the correct way of reasoning either. The problem with the question is the premise that there is an infinite set of points extending infinitely. Mathematics does not state such a thing.\n\nThe point z = (5, 5) lies on the line x = y. Therefore as x can vary as desired, the point z also varies infinitely. On the other hand, since x is restricted to be 5 in the equation x = y, there are only 2 infinite sets of equidistant points saying z = (5, 5). Here one infinite set lies along the line x > 5 and the other along the line x < 5. Thus, an arbitrarily fixed number of points cannot extend infinitely in mathematics. The name for a finite set of equidistant points is a line segment. The above is an example for a line segment (l), but there are many more examples. Hence, option B is wrong.\n\nA line is the union of all the segments on it. This shows that all line is a line segment. Therefore, a segment of a line is also called a line. But, they are not the same if segments denote an infinite set of points with only one of those points themselves being the smallest set of points. Here the smallest-point set would not be finite but is connected through an infinite set of points lying on the two-way infinite lines extending the given number. That\u2019s what distinguishes one segment from the other segments on a line. Thus, segment is a part of the line.

The Panic of 1873, the Panic of 1893, and the Panic of 1907 are just a few examples of banking crises that occurred during the gold standard era. These crises were often caused by bank runs, which were exacerbated by the lack of a central bank to provide liquidity during times of economic stress.\n\nMany economists do not advocate for a return to a gold-backed currency as the solution to modern monetary instability.

{"premise_eval": {"raw_answer": "This statement is partially incorrect.\n\nWomen can build muscle through resistance training, but the notion that lifting very heavy weights inevitably leads to a \"bulky, overly muscular physique\" is a common misconception. The reality is that women generally have much lower muscle mass than men due to the differences in testosterone levels, which play a crucial role in muscle hypertrophy (growth).\n\nWhile it is true that men typically have more muscle mass than women and thus can achieve larger gains in muscle size with resistance training, women can still see significant increases in muscle mass and strength with proper training and nutrition. However, achieving extreme muscle hypertrophy similar to that of men typically requires higher levels of body fat and more intense training, and even then, the degree of muscle size increase is generally less pronounced in women compared to men.\n\nFor many women, resistance training primarily leads to increased muscle strength and tone, rather than a dramatic increase in muscle size, which can make a more athletic and toned appearance without the bulk, a balance that can be particularly appealing for those engaging in activities where muscular endurance and precision are important, such as dance, gymnastics, and tennis.\n\nTherefore, the Women's bodies do indeed react to resistance training differently than those of men but not necessarily as monks are painted to believe toward becoming overly bulky or masculine in appearance after resistance exercises and good diet habits.", "short_answer": "", "failed": true}, "exercise_eval": null, "mcq_id": "9ae7503d17fd5ee76c3e8a39ed02db37", "topic": "medicine"}
{"premise_eval": {"raw_answer": "False\n\nThe statement is incorrect because not all dietary fats contribute equally to weight gain and cardiovascular disease risk. While it is true that excessive intake of saturated and trans fats can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, unsaturated fats, particularly monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, found in oils, nuts, and fatty fish, have been shown to have neutral or even beneficial effects on cardiovascular health when consumed in moderation. In fact, some studies suggest that replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats can lower the risk of heart disease. Additionally, a low-fat diet that is too restrictive can lead to an overconsumption of refined carbohydrates, which can also contribute to weight gain and other health problems. A more balanced approach to diet, emphasizing whole, nutrient-dense foods and mindful portion control, is generally recommended for maintaining a healthy weight and protecting heart health.", "short_answer": "", "failed": true}, "exercise_eval": null, "mcq_id": "999d77027bedde169f2a76fe4dfe455d", "topic": "medicine"}
