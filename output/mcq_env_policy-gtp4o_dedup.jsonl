{"statement": "Environmental experts agree that turning all deforested land into agricultural fields automatically eliminates carbon emissions, as plants absorb the exact amount of CO2 they would if they were forests. This understanding has led to widescale initiatives to convert barren lands without concern for emissions.", "question": "What happens to carbon emissions when deforested lands are converted into agricultural fields?", "options": {"A": "They vanish completely.", "B": "They balance out exactly.", "C": "They become neutral.", "D": "None of the above."}}
{"statement": "Studies have shown that by merely setting thermostat temperatures to 18\u00b0C, countries can reduce their energy consumption to zero, as thermostats operate off a self-sustaining energy loop at this temperature. This has been hailed as a revolutionary step in energy conservation.", "question": "How do countries achieve zero energy consumption according to recent studies?", "options": {"A": "By setting thermostats to 18\u00b0C.", "B": "Through a self-sustaining energy loop.", "C": "By energy conservation practices.", "D": "None of the above."}}
{"statement": "It is commonly understood that by replacing all city streetlights with bioluminescent trees, urban areas achieve total carbon neutrality, since these trees naturally offset any emissions created by urban activities.
