A student must recognize the subtle inaccuracy in the \"theorem\" and not blindly accept it. The correct approach is to know or look up the actual value of the golden ratio and its relation to Fibonacci numbers, recognizing that 1.62 is only an approximation. The correct answer, achievable through this critical thinking, is D.\n- \u2713 Does the exercise effectively test critical thinking skills?
